Canadian Border Services has some information for [Visitors to Canada](http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel-voyage/ivc-rnc-eng.html). That page has information about the Electronic Travel Authorisation (eTA), and visas.

If you dont need a visa to get to Canada (EU folks) then you will need to get an ETA. Please visit this site: [http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/eta.asp](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/eta.asp) And for a quick test of whether you need it go here: [http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/visas.asp](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/visas.asp)

The list of countries whose citizens need a visa to enter Canada is [here](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/visas.asp). {% endcomment %}

## Getting to/from the airport

## Taxi

In addition to providing you with a safe and reliable ride, Vancouver taxi companies ensure all drivers receive extensive training through the award-winning TaxiHost training program.  
All licensed taxis are allowed to drop-off passengers at YVR, and they will use the meter to determine the fare.

If you’re taking a taxi from the airport to your hotel after arriving at YVR, use one of the taxi stands located on Level 2. Taxis operating from the airport are licensed, and will use a zoned fare rate that will depend on your destination.

The conference is located in Zone 9: Canada Place/Downtown and should cost $36. More information can be found at this link: [https://www.yvr.ca/en/passengers/transportation/taxis](https://www.yvr.ca/en/passengers/transportation/taxis)

## Public Transit

The SkyTrain’s Canada Line provides rapid rail service linking YVR to downtown Vancouver and parts of Richmond. Trains leave the airport station approximately every seven minutes during most times of the day.

The trip from YVR to downtown Vancouver takes only 26 minutes on a two zone fare of $4.25, plus the $5.00 Canada Line YVR AddFare. The YVR AddFare is waived if you have a pre-purchased fare, e.g. a day pass, monthly pass or a Fare Saver ticket.

Tickets can be bought at the SkyTrain station. Check the TransLink website for maps, schedules and fare information: [http://www.translink.ca](http://www.translink.ca)

### Directions by SkyTrain to Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront, 1133 W Hastings St, Vancouver, BC V6E 3T3

You will take the Canada Line to Waterfront station stop. From this station it is 700 meters to the hotel.

## Uber

Please note that Uber has recently started operating in Vancouver, so that's an option for getting around as well.

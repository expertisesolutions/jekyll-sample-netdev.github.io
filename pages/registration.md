Details coming soon.

If you yearn for the old community tech driven conferences where you mingle with fellow Linux networking geeks then this would be it. While there will be a heavy Linux kernel influence we expect a lot of user space presence as well.

Netdev 0x16 is in Lisbon Portugal, starting October 24th, 2022. You can also attend virtually if you prefer.
  
Registration is now open! Click the link below to register. Note that when registering, the Name, Email, and Country fields are mandatory for you to fill in, and the other ones are not.

## Cancellation Policy

  

**Info for people who wish to cancel because the date changed and the conference is now virtual:**  
  
If you are already registered at the previous rate and you are able to attend remotely on the new date, you can request a price adjustment for the new lower rate by sending an email to [registrar@netdevconf.info](mailto:registrar@netdevconf.info) before the conference starts, otherwise we will carry over your remaining balance for admission to the next conference, Netdev 0x16. All current registrations are already applied to the new date for the virtual Netdev 0x16 conference.  
  
If you registered before we changed the date and no longer wish to participate, **you can cancel your registration for a refund minus a 7% processing fee until August 16th, 2020**. To cancel registration please send a request to [registrar@netdevconf.info](mailto:registrar@netdevconf.info).  
  
Note that if you qualify for the tshirt and badge, and you cancel registration after we ship them to you, the 50% refund will apply instead of the 7% processing fee.

## Submissions Overview


A call for submissions will be announced soon, stay tuned!

{% comment %}

Netdev Society is excited to be accepting submissions for Netdev 0x17. We
encourage early submissions incrementally rather than wait to submit at the
last minute before the deadline.

Submissions will be accepted until the 7th of September, 2022. The submitters
will be notified whether their submission was accepted or rejected by 15th of
September, 2022. Slides and papers (for talks) are expected by 7th of
September, 2022.

The Netdev Society invites proposals for conference topics in the area of Linux
kernel and user space networking. Please stay within the relevant topic focus
and tie to FOSS Linux networking. In other words if you are just _using Linux
to boot your proprietary SDK-based system_ then your submission will probably
not be accepted. **Also note that _we do not accept submissions of recycled
talks_**.

<ins>Netdev Society strives for objectivity in reviewing submissions. </ins>
Submissions are reviewed in a double blind review solely based on their
technical merit and suitability for the conference. Any conflict of interest is
cleared upfront and no reviewer is able to see the submitters name or
organization.

Our Program Committee is listed here:
[https://netdevconf.info/0x17/about-us.html#Committees](https://netdevconf.info/0x17/about-us.html#Committees)

For Netdev 0x17 the following is a sample space of topics of interest:

- Machine learning as related to networking
- Communication patterns
- RDMA techniques
- networking vs interface effects
- Network Analytics
- Mobile Edge Computing
- User space infrastructures (example config tooling, L2/3 like FRR, DNS, etc)
- XDP+EBPF
- DDOS related
- IoT
- Wireless
- Driver enhancements in Linux
- Performance analysis and improvement
- Networking hardware and offload
- Netfilter
- Traffic control
- Protocol development, implementation, and optimization
- L2/3
- Transport: TCP, QUIC, UDP
- Security

Feel free to step out of these boundaries if you feel your topic is still relevant.

## Submission Types

1.  **Talk** - One or more of authors elaborating on a proposal within a 30
    minute session. A 2-10 pages (not including references) paper submission of
    the talk is required in PDF format. Talks can be labelled as
    "Nuts-and-bolts" as well as "moonshot" submissions. Refer to label
    definitions for insights.
2.  **Workshops** - Workshops are always "Nuts-and-bolts". Workshops are
    proposed by one or more chairs. workshop chairs(s) should coordinate
    workshop participants' topics in advance and lead the session. Topics
    should be extensions of mailing list discussions. The meeting will
    typically take place in a round-table format. Length of the workshop can
    vary (within reason) and no slides nor paper(s) are required; however, this
    requirement may be overridden by the chair(s) of the workshop. Workshops
    could also be deep-dive sessions where domain experts would flock to
    discuss details of a specific topic.
3.  **Tutorial** - Tutorials are educational in nature and fit under the
    "hands-on" label. These sessions will be held in classroom style. Two types
    of tutorials may be accepted:
    1.  Instructor-led sessions - minimum 1 hour long and not to exceed 1.5
        hours. The instructor will go over the technology either through code
        review or execution and interact with the attendees.
    2.  Student-participation session. Minimum 2 hours upto a maximum 3 hours.
        Preference for such sessions is to have hands-on user participation; we
        encourage tutors to prepare VMs or container images for this activity.

## Submission Labels

Submission labels are based on the observation that there is a natural 3-step
progression of a technology over time consisting of 1) inception 2) development
and 3) deployment. The labels are aligned to these steps:

- **Moonshot** - These are sessions about the next big thing in Linux kernel
  networking. If you are thinking about new and exciting technology or a big
  idea and want feedback, then consider submitting a "moonshot" proposal. As an
  example, the first time XDP was presented in Netdev it would have probably
  qualified as a "moonshot".
- **Nuts and bolts** - These are presentations that might take a deep dive into
  implementation and development of technology in Linux kernel networking. If
  you have well tested ideas and code that you would like to push forward
  inclusion and adoption by the community (kernel/user space) then consider
  submitting a "nuts and bolts" proposal. It is also acceptable in a "nuts and
  bolts" session to have a talk to document how things work under the covers
  especially if they are already in deployment in the kernel/user space but
  have never been documented. An example of a "nuts and bolts" session is DSA
  which was first described in Netdev 2.1.
- **Hands on** - These are more what traditionally has been thought of as
  tutorials. These sessions focus on configuring and using Linux kernel
  networking technologies and features. This is an opportunity to share
  deployment experience and wisdom about how to best employ kernel technology.
  To provide a truly "hands on" experience, there should be real examples and
  case studies presented that the audience could try out in real time. Previous
  Netdev sessions on iptables are good examples of "hands on" sessions.

When you make a submission, make sure you indicate what label best applies.

## Submitting proposals

Proposal submissions guidelines:

1.  Create a new account on:
    [https://0x17.netdevconf.info](https://0x17.netdevconf.info)
2.  Check your email for a verification link.
3.  Log into the submissions site using your new account (same link as from
    step 1)
4.  Fill in your name, change your password, and add any conflicts of interest
    that you're aware of at the bottom. Save your changes with the button at
    the bottom of the page.
5.  You will now be on the front page. Next to "Submissions", click "New
    submission", and fill out the form to submit your proposal.
6.  You will receive an email acknowledging that you submission has been
    entered into the system.

In the unlikely case you don't receive any email after registration or
submission, please contact the Administrator at: admin@netdevconf.info

We provide one registration coupon per submission that is accepted. You may go
ahead and register for the conference. If you're already registered then you
will be refunded as a speaker. If you're not registered already then your
registration fee will be waived. Please remember that missed deadline could
lead to your submitted session(s) being cancelled.

Once your proposal is accepted, please prepare your paper based on [odt
template](../netdevconf-template.odt) or [latex one](../ISEA-Latex.zip).

Accepted talk presenter(s) should submit a draft PDF version of slides and
papers in the submission page on the same site as registration by the deadline
of September 7th 2022.

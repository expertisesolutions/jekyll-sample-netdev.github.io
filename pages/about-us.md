# About Us

The NetDev Society has been established for the purpose of advancing the Linux networking user and kernel open source software by, among other things, providing a forum for collaboration through conferences and other activities. It is operated by volunteer netdev community members. It is not a trade association. Our goal is to serve the netdev community.

## Privacy Statements

### Web site

We don't explicitly collect information from you. If we start to collect
information, we will update this part. As most other websites, we gather basic
traffic stats, including your IP address/IP address of your proxy as system
default. We neither share nor look at them ourselves, but will look into
addressing this issue at earliest chance.

{% comment %}
We put the web site under HTTPS, so the requests and responses are encrypted
(private).

We don't use any third-party suppliers for the web site - no third-party
analytics, no third-party graphics, no third-party js or other supporting
files. Whatever supporting files we use (js, css) we host ourselves. So far,
there is no javascript and no plan to put any in. We lack the time to implement
a fancy user experience - if someone wants to volunteer we won't necessarily
refuse but we also don't want to compromise privacy/security either. So there
won't be any third-party-hosting of our web assets, but we might start to use
javascript libraries. However our site will be usable without javascript, if
you turn it off at your end.

### Mailing lists

{% comment %}

We have two types of mailing lists: one at lists.netfilter.org (thanks Pablo)
and the others hosted by us.

{% endcomment %}

Your subscription information on mailinglist are collected by and kept within
ourselves. We assure you we neither sell nor share your information with
anyone.

### Payment Information

Payment information is not collected or stored on any servers operated by the
NetDev Society. When you register your payment and payment card information
will be entered directly into a third-party processor's systems and is not
transmitted through or stored by our websites. We make reasonable efforts to
ensure that our third-party processors handle your non-public information
responsibly.

### Registration Information

We collect information from people who register for meetings. This information
is used for logistics of running the conference (eg food allergies and dietary
choices are used to ensure we cater for our attendees). We collect tshirt sizes
and country information for our analytics. This information is summarized in
the closing ceremony. Our attendee list is not public and is not shared with
any third parties (such as sponsors).

{% comment %}

### Information for letters of invitation

We delete the personal information that we collect to generate letters of
invitation in a timely fashion after each meeting. We request that local
organizations with whom we share this data to generate the letters also delete
it in a timely fashion.

## Anti-Harassment Policy

The NetDev Society is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference
experience for everyone regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability,
physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate
harassment of conference participants in any form and we expect participants to
comply with our anti-harrassment policy at all conference venues and
conference-related social events.

Harassment includes sexual languages and images in venue spaces, deliberate
intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, sustained
disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, unwelcome
sexual attention, and offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.
Conference participants violating this policy may be sanctioned or expelled
from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference
organizers.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.

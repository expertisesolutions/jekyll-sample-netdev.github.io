# Welcome to Netdev 0x16!

### Weather

The temperatures in March are typically mild, usually staying between 40 degrees Fahrenheit and 50 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius and 10 degrees Celsius).  
It rains on average 20 days in March. The chances of rain remain a fairly constant 47% throughout the entire month.

### What to Wear?

Leave the heavy duty winter wear at home and pack warm, waterproof clothing instead. Sweaters, sweatshirts, and light jackets are a good bet, and because of the rain, you will need rain boots, a raincoat, and an umbrella.

### Power outlets in Canada

In Canada the power plugs and sockets are of type A and B. The standard voltage is 120 V and the standard frequency is 60 Hz.

## Stanley Park

Stanley Park is Vancouver's first, largest, and most beloved urban park!  

It is a magnificent green oasis in the midst of the urban landscape of Vancouver. Explore the 400-hectare natural West Coast rainforest and enjoy scenic views of water, mountains, sky, and majestic trees along Stanley Park's famous Seawall.

## Going for a walk?

Vancouver is home to many vibrant and interesting areas. Here are a few to start you on your exploration of the city!

### Coal Harbour Neighbourhood

Despite the fact that Coal Harbour is right downtown, it’s a surprisingly calm little neighbourhood, right on the water’s edge. It’s even more surprising given its industrial history as a former shipyard sitting right next to the railway terminus.  
The area starts at Canada Place and stretches west to Stanley Park, and is bordered by Burrard Inlet to the north, West Georgia Street to the south.  
Coal Harbour is a charming mix of business and residential, being home to both the Vancouver Convention Centre as well as condo towers. Around this area you’ll find locals and visitors mingling on the Seawall, neighbourhood cafes and restaurants, a popular marina, and the odd harbour seal bobbing around and greeting passersby.

### Robson Street

With BC Place Stadium at one end, Stanley Park at the other, and the city’s best-known shopping precinct in between, Robson Street is a must-stroll for most visitors to Vancouver.  
One of Vancouver’s oldest commercial streets, it was once known as Robsonstrasse for the sheer number of German and European stores that opened up after the Second World War. The international character of the street still exists.  
Being right in the heart of the downtown core, you’ll find yourself walking right alongside locals on their way to the office, sports fans heading to the game, and Asian students lining up outside noodle shops.

### West End

Tucked up tightly against the city’s downtown core, the West End is one of the easiest neighbourhoods for visitors to explore, getting a real taste of how real Vancouverites live. A gateway to Stanley Park, the neighbourhood is bordered by the park on one side, as well as English Bay, Granville and Robson Streets.  
In 1862, the area was heavily forested when three gentlemen, known as the Three Greenhorns, each purchased 73 hectares (180 acres) of land with the purpose of establishing a brickworks. That plan soon changed, and the area instead became the city’s first upscale neighbourhood.  
These days, it’s an incredibly diverse area, home to the city’s gay community (centred around Davie Village), heritage homes, and around 40,000 people living in high-rise apartments. The parks and beaches are the main attractions, but the people-watching and dining come in close behind.

### Yaletown

Yaletown was once the Western terminus for the Canadian Pacific Railway, but the area’s more recent reinvention dates back to 1986 when the waterfront along the north of False Creek was host to many of the venues when Vancouver hosted the World’s Fair.  
Since then that land, along with the warehouse district adjoining it have been transformed into one of the city’s chicest neighbourhoods, filled with residential loft spaces, sidewalk cafes, cool restaurants, unique shopping, and leafy parks.  
Sitting along the south side of the downtown Vancouver peninsula, Yaletown is bordered by Homer Street, Robson Street and False Creek.

### Gastown

Vancouver’s oldest neighbourhood, Gastown grew from a single tavern founded by John ‘Gassy Jack’ Deighton back in 1867. Today, the district retains its historic charm and independent spirit.  
Victorian architecture houses a thriving fashion scene, impeccably curated décor boutiques, one-of-a-kind galleries and some of the best culinary fare in Vancouver. It’s a gathering place for stylish locals and an ideal neighbourhood to explore on foot.  
Gastown lies along the north of the downtown Vancouver peninsula, from Richards east to Main Street, and south to Hastings Street.

### Chinatown

Established back in the 1890s, Vancouver’s Chinatown has been humming busily for more than a century with vivid colours, exotic cuisine and a vibrant culture.  
Vancouver’s Chinese population originally made the journey to work in local mines and build the Trans-Canada railway. Rich in history and architecture, this area east of downtown boasts North America's third-largest Chinatown after New York and San Francisco.  
The main commercial area runs is around six blocks, bordered by East Pender Street, Gore Avenue, East Georgia Street, and Carrall Street.  
You’ll find plenty of classic Asian specialty stores, with their wares piled by the sidewalk for perusing, as well as dim sum restaurants, apothecaries, and quiet oases offering calm respite from the bustle.  
While there are many traditional finds in Chinatown, you’ll also see a burst of modern retail thanks to some young entrepreneurs who have set up shop in the neighbourhood, especially along Pender between Columbia and Main streets.

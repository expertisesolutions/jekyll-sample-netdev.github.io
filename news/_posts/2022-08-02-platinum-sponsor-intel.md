Open Source Software isn’t just important for [Intel](https://www.intel.com/), it’s absolutely critical for its success in data center networking and edge computing. For many years Intel has been one of the leading contributors to Linux kernel and Linux networking technologies. This year we continue our tradition of enthusiastic support and participation in Netdev with our platinum sponsorship.

Agenda is still a Work in Progress. But we will be discussing the work in
Segment Routing  for both OSPF and ISIS, RFC compliance in BGP, continued work
on Nexthop Groups and further dataplane integration work being done.  Finally
we'll discuss the recent releases and what would people like to see from FRR
itself in the future.

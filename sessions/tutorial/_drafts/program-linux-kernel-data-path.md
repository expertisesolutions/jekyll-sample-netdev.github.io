Originally targeting high-throughput switching ASICs, and quite rapidly
supported onto lower throughput hardware platforms like FGPAs and smartNICs,
the P4 language has lately embraced software packet processors too, aiming to
become the standard language for programming the network data plane end-to-end.
At present, several compilers and software/hardware targets are available to
program a network's behavior with P4. The open-source offer spans from software
for educational and prototyping purposes, like the bmv2 software switch, to
production-level solutions for OpenVSwitch and the Linux Kernel.
<br/>
This tutorial aims at introducing data-plane programming with P4 through some
of the available open-source software. To help the audience get really started
with P4, the tutorial will feature a hands-on part where the participants will
learn how to program custom packet processing logic into the Linux kernel
through several open-source P4 technologies.
